# Using Fine.dev AI with BookSmartly

This guide provides instructions and best practices for using Fine.dev's AI capabilities to enhance and maintain the BookSmartly project.

## Getting Started with Fine.dev AI

Fine.dev AI is an AI coding agent that can help you build, maintain, and improve your BookSmartly application. Here's how to get started:

1. Import your BookSmartly repository to Fine.dev
2. Configure your project settings
3. Start interacting with the AI through the AI Palette

## AI Palette

The AI Palette is the quickest way to interact with Fine.dev AI. To use it:

1. Click on the AI Palette icon in the Fine.dev interface
2. Select "BookSmartly" from the project dropdown
3. Choose your preferred AI model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet recommended)
4. Type your request in plain language

### Example Queries

Here are some example queries you can use with the AI Palette:

- "Explain how the authentication system works in BookSmartly"
- "Find all places where we handle appointment creation"
- "Generate documentation for the analytics API"
- "Suggest improvements for the calendar view component"

## Implementing New Features

To implement new features using Fine.dev AI:

1. Start a new conversation with the Agent
2. Clearly describe the feature you want to add
3. Review the implementation plan proposed by the AI
4. Click "Implement" to have the AI make the changes
5. Test the changes in the AI Sandbox
6. Create a PR when satisfied

### Example Feature Requests

Here are some example feature requests you can make:

```
Add a feature to allow users to export their appointments to a CSV file. 
The export should include appointment title, date, time, and location.
```

```
Implement a notification system that sends email reminders to users 
24 hours before their scheduled appointments.
```

```
Create a recurring appointments feature that allows users to schedule 
appointments that repeat daily, weekly, or monthly.
```

## Fixing Bugs

To fix bugs using Fine.dev AI:

1. Start a new conversation with the Agent
2. Describe the bug in detail, including steps to reproduce
3. Review the AI's analysis and proposed solution
4. Click "Implement" to have the AI make the changes
5. Test the fix in the AI Sandbox
6. Create a PR with the fix

### Example Bug Reports

Here are some example bug reports you can make:

```
Fix the issue where the calendar doesn't update immediately after creating 
a new appointment. Currently, users have to refresh the page to see new appointments.
```

```
There's a bug in the analytics dashboard where the "Appointments by Day" chart 
shows incorrect data when filtering by date range. The chart should update 
based on the selected date range.
```

## Code Refactoring

To refactor code using Fine.dev AI:

1. Start a new conversation with the Agent
2. Describe the refactoring you want to perform
3. Review the AI's analysis and proposed changes
4. Click "Implement" to have the AI make the changes
5. Test the refactored code in the AI Sandbox
6. Create a PR with the refactored code

### Example Refactoring Requests

Here are some example refactoring requests you can make:

```
Refactor the appointment form component to use React Hook Form instead of 
the current manual form handling.
```

```
Convert all class components to functional components with hooks.
```

```
Improve error handling throughout the application by implementing a 
consistent error handling pattern.
```

## Using GitHub PR Integration

Fine.dev integrates with GitHub PRs, allowing you to:

1. Request AI reviews of PRs
2. Ask the AI to explain code changes
3. Request revisions to PRs

### Example PR Commands

Here are some example PR commands you can use:

- `/revise Fix the styling issues in the calendar component`
- `/summary Provide a summary of the changes in this PR`
- `/ask Why was this approach chosen for handling authentication?`

## Best Practices

For the best results with Fine.dev AI:

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed instructions
2. **Start Small**: Begin with smaller tasks to get familiar with the AI's capabilities
3. **Provide Context**: Tag relevant files using the @ symbol
4. **Review Carefully**: Always review the AI's changes before merging
5. **Iterative Approach**: Break complex tasks into smaller steps
6. **Use Project Instructions**: Add custom instructions in the project settings

## Project-Specific Instructions

When working with BookSmartly, keep these specific guidelines in mind:

1. **Authentication**: Always use the Fine.dev SDK for authentication
2. **Database Operations**: Use the Fine.dev SDK for database operations
3. **Component Structure**: Follow the existing component structure
4. **Styling**: Use TailwindCSS for styling
5. **State Management**: Use Redux Toolkit for global state management
6. **API Services**: Follow the pattern in the `src/api` directory
7. **Type Safety**: Maintain TypeScript types in `src/lib/db-types.ts`

## Troubleshooting AI Interactions

If you encounter issues with Fine.dev AI:

1. **Unclear Responses**: Rephrase your request with more specific details
2. **Incorrect Code**: Provide feedback and ask the AI to fix specific issues
3. **Context Limitations**: Break down large tasks into smaller chunks
4. **Deployment Issues**: Check the deployment.md file for troubleshooting steps

## Advanced AI Usage

For advanced users, Fine.dev AI can:

1. **Generate Tests**: Ask the AI to generate unit and integration tests
2. **Performance Optimization**: Request performance analysis and optimizations
3. **Security Audits**: Ask the AI to review code for security vulnerabilities
4. **Documentation Generation**: Generate comprehensive documentation
5. **Code Migration**: Help migrate code to newer libraries or frameworks

Remember that Fine.dev AI is a tool to enhance your productivity, not replace your judgment. Always review the AI's output and make the final decisions about your codebase.
